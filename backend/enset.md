Comprehensive Institutional Report: École Normale Supérieure de l'Enseignement Technique (ENSET) de Mohammedia1. Institutional Overview and Strategic MandateThe École Normale Supérieure de l'Enseignement Technique (ENSET) of Mohammedia occupies a distinct and historically significant position within the architecture of Moroccan higher education. Affiliated with Hassan II University of Casablanca (UH2C), one of the Maghreb's most prominent academic institutions, ENSET Mohammedia has evolved from its foundational mission of training technical educators to become a premier polytechnic institution. Its current mandate is dualistic and synergistic: it functions simultaneously as a Grande École d'Ingénieurs, producing state engineers (Ingénieurs d'État) for the industrial and service sectors, and as a center of excellence for pedagogical training via its Agrégation and educational license programs.1Located in the coastal industrial hub of Mohammedia, often referred to as the "City of Flowers and Sports" but crucially also a center for energy and logistics, the school benefits from a strategic geographic proximity to the Casablanca-Rabat economic axis. This location is not merely administrative but functional; it places the institution at the heart of Morocco's industrial corridor, facilitating the "University-Enterprise" dynamic that is central to its pedagogical philosophy. The campus, situated on Boulevard Hassan II (BP 159), serves as a physical interface between academic theory and industrial practice.2The institution's governance operates under the broader regulatory framework of the Ministry of Higher Education, Scientific Research, and Innovation, yet it retains significant autonomy in crafting its strategic development plans. The administration is structured to support a complex ecosystem of initial training (Formation Initiale), continuing education (Formation Continue), and doctoral research. As of the 2025-2026 academic year, the school's leadership has prioritized the digitalization of administrative processes and the modernization of curricula to align with the "Industry 4.0" paradigm, evidenced by the introduction of advanced fields such as Cybersecurity and Big Data alongside traditional mechanical and electrical engineering disciplines.4The strategic vision of ENSET Mohammedia is deeply entwined with the Nouveau Modèle de Développement (New Development Model) of Morocco, which emphasizes the valorization of human capital and the strengthening of technical competencies. By maintaining a rigorous selection process—admitting students from the Concours National Commun (CNC) and via selective bridges for DUT/BTS holders—the school ensures that its cohorts represent the upper echelon of technical aptitude.6 Furthermore, the school’s commitment to social mobility and accessibility is reflected in its adherence to public education standards, providing tuition-free excellence while managing a diverse student body that includes international candidates and students from across the Kingdom.2. Governance, Infrastructure, and Digital Environment2.1 Administrative Structure and GovernanceThe governance of ENSET Mohammedia follows a hierarchical yet consultative model typical of Moroccan university institutions. At the apex is the Director, who executes the strategic decisions validated by the School Council (Conseil de l'Établissement). This council comprises elected representatives from the faculty, administrative staff, and student body, ensuring a participatory approach to management.The administrative apparatus is divided into key service areas:Academic Affairs: Manages the scheduling of courses, examinations, and the implementation of the pedagogical norms (Cahiers des Normes). Snippets indicating the release of provisional timetables for the Autumn semester of 2025-2026 underscore the logistical complexity managed by this department, which coordinates hundreds of modules across varying cycles.8Research and Partnership Service: This critical unit overlooks the doctoral cycles and manages the interface with the industrial world. It handles the administrative registration of doctoral candidates, the organization of thesis defenses, and the management of research grants. The service plays a pivotal role in ensuring that research outputs from the SSDIA laboratory translate into tangible partnerships.9Student Affairs: Responsible for the holistic well-being of the student population, handling scholarships, insurance (AMO - Assurance Maladie Obligatoire), and extracurricular activities. The recent implementation of digital tools for insurance payments and enrollment reflects a modernization drive within this service.22.2 Campus Infrastructure and ResourcesThe physical campus on Boulevard Hassan II is designed to function as a self-contained academic village. While the school does not possess internal boarding facilities—a significant logistical factor for incoming students—it compensates with a robust academic infrastructure. The campus houses:Amphitheaters and Lecture Halls: Equipped for mass instruction, particularly for the transversal modules shared across departments.Specialized Laboratories: Unlike generalist classrooms, ENSET features workshops and labs tailored to its technical specializations. The Mechanical Engineering department, for instance, requires heavy machinery for material testing and manufacturing simulations, while the Electrical Engineering department relies on test benches for automation and electrotechnics.11Digital Navigation Systems: In a move towards a "Smart Campus," the administration has deployed an interactive guidance system. During competitive entrance exams, candidates use QR codes scattered across the campus to access real-time augmented reality or map-based directions to their specific examination halls. This system reduces logistical friction during high-stress periods like the CNC integration weeks.42.3 The Digital EcosystemThe digital transformation at ENSET is not limited to campus navigation. The institution utilizes a comprehensive "Environnement Numérique de Travail" (ENT) or Virtual Learning Environment. This platform serves as the nerve center for academic life, where students access:Official Timetables: Dynamic schedules that change with faculty availability and room allocations.8Results and convocations: The "guichet unique" for academic progression, where lists of eligible candidates for oral exams and final admission results are posted.4Distance Learning Resources: While primarily an on-site institution, the post-pandemic era has cemented the role of e-learning platforms for supplementary materials, particularly in the Digitalisation des Processus Éducatifs master's track.123. The Engineering Cycle: Curriculum and CompetenciesThe Cycle d'Ingénieur represents the core identity of ENSET Mohammedia. It is a three-year professionalizing curriculum (Bac+5 level) designed to take students with a strong theoretical background (Math/Physics from CPGE or DEUG/DUT) and transform them into operational engineers. The pedagogical model is built on the "Approche Par Compétences" (Competency-Based Approach), prioritizing the ability to mobilize knowledge to solve complex industrial problems over mere rote learning.3.1 Department of Mechanical Engineering ProgramsThe Mechanical Engineering Department is a pillar of the school, reflecting the industrial character of the Mohammedia-Casablanca region.

They also sit on the School Council, influencing strategic direction.8. Student Life, Housing, and ExtracurricularsThe student experience at ENSET is shaped by both the academic rigor and the specific logistical conditions of the Mohammedia campus.8.1 The Housing ChallengeA defining characteristic of ENSET Mohammedia is the absence of an on-campus boarding school (Internat) or internal restaurant. This presents a logistical challenge for the student body, which is drawn from across Morocco.36Cités Universitaires: To mitigate this, students rely on the public university housing network managed by ONOUSC (Office National des Œuvres Universitaires Sociales et Culturelles).Facilities: The primary option is the Cité Universitaire Mohammedia, which has a capacity of approximately 1,590 beds for girls and 1,908 beds for boys (shared across different institutions in the city).37Process: Admission to the Cité is not automatic. It is based on social criteria (parental income, distance from home) and academic merit. The application window typically opens in late summer.38Private Solutions: Many students resort to private rentals ("Saknia Chaabi") in the neighborhoods surrounding Boulevard Hassan II, or private residences like "Bayt Al Maarifa," which offer higher-end amenities at a higher cost.408.2 Associative Life and ClubsDespite the lack of a residential campus, student life is vibrant, driven by the ADE (Association des Étudiants) and various specialized clubs.Civic Engagement: Clubs like the "Club des Étudiants" organize major events such as the "Ingénieurs sans frontières" (Engineers Without Borders) day. These events emphasize the engineer's social responsibility.41Tech Clubs: The DigiGirlz ENSET Mohammedia club is a standout example. Focused on empowering women in technology, they have achieved national recognition, winning the 2nd Prize in the DigiGirlz Mentorship Program with their project "MyGuide." This indicates a strong culture of mentorship and peer-to-peer learning.1Integration: The beginning of the year is marked by integration events for new students, fostering a sense of "Espress" (ENSET Spirit) that binds alumni together.9. Admissions Strategy and Competitive EntranceENSET Mohammedia positions itself as a selective elite institution. The admissions process is designed to filter for high-potential candidates.9.1 Access to the Engineering CycleThe school uses a dual-entry system to diversify its intake.The CNC Route: A significant portion of the cohort comes from the Classes Préparatoires (CPGE) via the Concours National Commun. These students bring intense theoretical preparation in Mathematics and Physics.The Passerelle Route (Parallel Admissions): This route allows high-achieving students from universities (DEUG, DUT, BTS, DTS) to join.Selectivity: Candidates must have obtained their diploma in two consecutive years (no repeats) with at least an "Assez Bien" or "Bien" distinction. This ensures that only the top tier of the university system enters the engineering cycle.6Exam Format: The entrance exam is rigorous.

This format allows for rapid, objective screening of hundreds of applicants.42Timeline: The process usually begins with pre-candidature in June/July, written exams in July, and final registration in September.49.2 Access to Doctoral StudiesAdmission to the doctoral cycle is a research-focused selection.Process: Candidates submit a research proposal aligned with one of the SSDIA lab's themes. They undergo an interview with a panel of professors to defend their proposal's feasibility and scientific value.Administrative Rigor: The registration involves signing the "Charte de Thèse" (Thesis Charter), a contract binding the student, the supervisor, and the institution to ethical and professional standards.1010. Industry Partnerships and EmployabilityThe ultimate metric of ENSET's success is the employability of its graduates. The "Formation-Emploi" adequacy is actively managed through partnerships.10.1 The Internship EcosystemInternships are not optional; they are pedagogical requirements.PFA (Projet de Fin d'Année): Occurs at the end of the 1st and 2nd years of the engineering cycle. It serves as an introduction to the corporate environment.PFE (Projet de Fin d'Études): The entire 6th semester is dedicated to this capstone project. Students work full-time in a company or research lab to solve a real-world problem. This PFE often acts as a pre-hiring trial period.Conventions: The school signs agreements to formalize these relationships. Recent snippets mention partnerships with companies like Sté XD Maroc, OBILOG France, and the Centre Technique de Plasturgie et de Caoutchouc.35 These specific partners highlight the school's strength in IT services and manufacturing.10.2 Academic CooperationENSET also collaborates with other academic institutions to broaden its horizon. A notable example is the partnership with ESLSCA Rabat. This convention aims to bridge the gap between engineering and business management, potentially leading to joint research or double-degree opportunities. It reflects a strategic awareness that modern engineers must also be managers.4311.
